# Polymer App Test 
I managed to complete most of Test 1 including styling with Bulma CSS however I couldnt finish the continuing tests in required timelines.
Apologies for the late submission.

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

Install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

    npm install -g polymer-cli@next

##### Initialize project from template

    mkdir my-app
    cd my-app
    polymer init polymer-3-starter-kit

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8081` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    npm start
